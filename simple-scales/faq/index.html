			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<h2>How do I change my preferred weight?</h2>
			<p>Simple Scales can use the weight unit set inside the Health app as your preferred unit. To change this, open Health and select Weight from the Body and Measurements category. Inside you can change your preferred unit.</p>
			
			<h2>What services does Simple Scales support?</h2>
			<p>We currently only support Apple HealthKit.</p>
			
			<h2>What devices does Simple Scales support?</h2>
			<p>Simple Scales currently works on devices that support HealthKit. Which are the iPhone, iPod touch, and Apple Watch.</p>
			
			<h2>Why does the complication on the Apple Watch not display any data?</h2>
			<p>We wanted to provide a shortcut for users to open the app on their watch easily without the pressure of seeing their current weight every time they look at the time. We believe it’s important to keep a healthy perspective on weight loss and as users of the app ourselves we don’t think seeing your current weight will help users be healthy, both physically or mentally. We understand that this might not be what everyone is looking for in a complication but we wanted to cater to the majority use-case in this instance.</p>
			
			<h2>Can Simple Scales be used to weight objects like a real set of scales?</h2>
			<p>No, Simple Scales is intended to work with traditional bathroom scales. You weigh yourself and then manually enter the value which gets saved to HealthKit. If you are looking to physically weigh something with your phone there are apps out there that use the 3D Touch sensor to accomplish this but the sensor can only detect the weight of small objects, like a coin.</p>
