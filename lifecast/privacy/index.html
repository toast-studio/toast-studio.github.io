			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Last Updated: 9 January 2019</p>
			<p>We treat the privacy of our customers very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from typedex.app (the "Site”).</p>
			<p>By using the Site you consent to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site indicates your acceptance of this policy and any modifications of it that we might make in the future. The current Privacy Policy will always be published here and can be checked at any time.</p>
			
			<h2 id="data-collection">Personal Information we Collect</h2>
			<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information.”</p>
			<p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">https://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li>
				<li>"Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>
				<li>"Web beacons,” "tags,” and "pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When we talk about "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information.</p>
			
			<h2 id="data-use">How do we use your personal information?</h2>
			<p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimise our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>
			
			<h2 id="sharing">Sharing your personal information</h2>
			<p>We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.  For example, we use  Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.  You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>
			<p>Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>
			
			<h2 id="do-not-track">Do not track</h2>
			<p>Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.</p>
			
			<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
			<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
